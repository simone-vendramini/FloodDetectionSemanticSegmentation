# Semantic Segmentation on the FloodNet Dataset

This repository contains the code for a project in the "Advanced Machine Learning"
course at the University of Milano-Bicocca. The objective is to implement a semantic
segmentation model on the FloodNet dataset [1].

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The FloodNet dataset comprises high-resolution aerial images capturing flooded areas.
Each image is annotated with one of ten classes:

0. Background
1. Building - Flooded
2. Building - Non-Flooded
3. Road - Flooded
4. Road - Non-Flooded
5. Water
6. Tree
7. Vehicle
8. Pool
9. Grass

The dataset is divided into three subsets:

* Training set: 1,445 images
* Validation set: 450 images
* Test set: 448 images

Each image is accompanied by a corresponding mask, which is a 3-channel image
where each pixel's integer value represents a class label.

The complete dataset can be downloaded from [FloodNet](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/k33qdif15ns2qv2jdxvhx/ANGaa8iPRhvlrvcKXjnmNRc?rlkey=ao2493wzl1cltonowjdbrnp7f&e=3&dl=0).
